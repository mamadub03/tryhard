Forest and Duolingo were our two biggest inspirations in making this project.

Forest inspired us because staying motivated to study is challenging, and Forest provides a visual incentive to study: a plant that grows in real-time as you study. As you pile on more study sessions, you build a forest of the plants you previously grew.
If you were to leave the app, your timer stops and your beautiful plant dies

We liked Duolingo because competition is a great way to spur excellence, and Duolingo does just that. In Duolingo, you can compete with your friends in learning languages, making learning even more fun!

What it does
With TryHard, you can connect with friends to compete against each other to study the longest.

After you start the timer, you will be prompted every 30 minutes to solve a short math problem to ensure you are actively studying (no cheating!). Once your timer ends, you can see how you did against your friends!
Just like Forest, if you were to leave the tab or close the window, your timer will end.

What's next for TryHard
Due to the time constraint, we could only add a few of the features we envisioned for TryHard. However, we plan to develop an iOS application that is user-friendly and more accessible to others.

Here is a list of features we plan to add:

Friend Requests
Different session types (math, science, English, etc)
Different leaderboard types (global, national, subject, friend, etc)
A visual representation of study time as it grows (e.g., plant growing in Forest app, resulting in a forest)
